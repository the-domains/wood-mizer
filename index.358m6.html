I look at this picture with great emotion that fills me up so much my whole body is shaking, At that moment I was so lost, and horrified at what I new was going to be the inevitable, yet was powerless to stop it. I was in the Cape here this was the second year, and I finally talked at that time my wife into going. I had been well at this point for a couple of weeks for the first time in my life from P.T.S.D. it was gone! Should have been the happiest days of my life. Yet let me tell you, when your eyes open for the first time in your life, and EVERYTHING, slows down to about 10 MPH, rather than the 115 MPH you have been traveling for 30 years…..FUCK ME!!! It had been 5 years I had been really sick with my wife. The morning I woke up and I knew I was well, I looked in her eyes, my soul dropped from my body, because she was gone. All her words said she was still hanging on, but her eyes they told the real story, and the horrific part of the whole thing is I could do nothing, but wait. Wait the longest year 1/2 of my life until her mouth told me, what her eyes already had.</li></ul></div></div></div></section><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="34"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="35"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f6f2cb89-a905-4797-a05a-4b1e512e5883.jpg" title="Looking back, just for a moment. " alt="Sorting my mind."><p>So I went about 34 years without ever falling in love, never being broken up with, the falling in love part well that was because I made sure I was shut down to all of those feelings. Why....I never felt grounded to a place, time would always pass and something would beat in me and I just would have to find a new adventure. On top of that I truly did not think I was capable of giving myself in that way. Why did I never get dumped....everyone I dated I believe truly liked, and some loved me a great deal. I have broken more people then I would like to think about, not because I wanted to, I just couldn't give what they were asking for. Sometimes it was the unfortunate case of being just an unhealthy relationship, and I needed to walk away. Then out of no where she walks through my door and as crazy as it sounds it was love at first site. I tried with everything that I'm made of to fight it, I even started a fight with her and told her not to talk to me any more. That did not work because we got married, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be married, yet be married to my soul mate. She was my everything, I had so many first feelings with her, I truly believed together no matter what came our way, we would always come out on top. I will spare you all the details, I will say Nov. age 40 she asked me for a divorce, there is no malevolent in her I don't blame her for leaving, yet I don't agree with it, we took vows, and how she left was just wrong. Needless to say this on top of a life of non stop surviving trauma a need to pause for a moment, because I can no longer find my go shoes, and that's scary as a hole full of spiders!</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="36"><!-- react-empty: 37 --></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 color-bg color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium p-0 text-align-left group-order-normal  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="38"><div class="Component ls-fx-r fx-w-w j-c-between a-i-stretch" data-reactid="39"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-0 fx-b-50p w-100p ls-w-50p" data-reactid="40"><a class="" data-reactid="41"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="42"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="43"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3d6f9c4c64cfa85466d08f5dccaeef0c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F1f973d72ecac4d113c5c523e8b2da1a7e20806dc.jpg&amp;width=1024" style="object-position:78.61328125% 96.20418848167539%;" data-reactid="44"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3d6f9c4c64cfa85466d08f5dccaeef0c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F1f973d72ecac4d113c5c523e8b2da1a7e20806dc.jpg&amp;width=1024" style="object-position:78.61328125% 96.20418848167539%;" data-reactid="45"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a535da384cf494669cc46a42db641fb8/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F1f973d72ecac4d113c5c523e8b2da1a7e20806dc.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:78.61328125% 96.20418848167539%;" data-reactid="46"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/34900661cb7e28ca481ae61941ebbc16/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F1f973d72ecac4d113c5c523e8b2da1a7e20806dc.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:78.61328125% 96.20418848167539%;" data-reactid="47"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="1024" data-height="764" data-ratio="1.3403141361256545" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3d6f9c4c64cfa85466d08f5dccaeef0c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F1f973d72ecac4d113c5c523e8b2da1a7e20806dc.jpg&amp;width=1024" style="object-position:78.61328125% 96.20418848167539%;" data-reactid="48"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-2 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title fx-b-50p" data-reactid="49"><!-- react-empty: 50 --><!-- react-empty: 51 --><!-- react-empty: 52 --><!-- react-empty: 53 --><!-- react-empty: 54 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="55"><p>As I sit here in the extreme quiet of this lonely house, I find myself in very unfamiliar waters.

I remember this like it was today, Zeppelin was playing very load I didn't know then, but now I know it was the Immigrant song. That day there was a big party, pretty much all of my DNA, everyone was as load as the radio, and walking very wobbly holding beer cans, or liquor bottles. For some reason I took a long look around, everything seemed to be in slow motion I thought to myself......I don't ever want to be like them, or live in a place like this when I grow up.Looking back on that now, I think WOW that's a pretty intense thought for a six year old! I truly believe that is when my life battle to get out, and be better then what I was born in to. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="74"><div class="Component p-2 ls-m-l-20p ls-m-r-0 ls-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="75"><p>WOW.......the wiring of our brains,  [Sparse Coding], I used to go about my life NEVER giving this one moment of my neurons time! Now there's days I have to stop myself from becoming fixated on it. You see this is my goal, my journey, and my road to my recovery in being healthy. Here's my...how do I say, life's work as a person to over come: I got P.T.S.D. as a very young child. Also it was from multiple incidents, and if P.T.S.D. is not caught and treated early your pretty much stuck with it for life. I didn't start treating mine until 5 1/2 years ago, really I didn't even know what it was for years, I thought I was crazy. I used to refer to the problem as movies that played in my head, only to myself OF COURSE!  We can sustain our brain with 86 billion tightly  packed neurons. That's 40% more then the ape. I'm sure everyone knows the brain is the most complex organ we have, yet to really put that in perspective is mind blowing. Is what at times is overwhelming to me is in order to get healthy  my brain is wired for the past 37 years to survive, now I have to rewire it to live. Believe me I have yet to back down or quit any challenge in my life, nor do I intend to do so with this one. I also have made peace with the fact that it will be something I will do most likely for the rest of my life. I want to be very clear about what I'm going to say next......My psychiatrist said something to me not to long ago that at the time did not really hit me until a couple weeks later. She said,"Mindy the only way your childhood could have been worse is if you were in slaved." Now I say this for a few different reasons, what trauma is to me, from what I understand is not to other people. I have seen and been through so much of it I don't even understand how bad it was to the full extent. Now with that being said, I still completely understand, and know I went through things no child should ever go though or even be aware of in those years. At the same time I also would not change one thing, it made me who I am, the good, and the really really hard. Life is a gift no matter what or who you believe in, and our lessons are the BIGGEST part of it [in my opinion] not every lesson is a happy one, or a easy one, but almost always those are the most important, in my experience. I will admit I do feel like my life has been A LOT of hard lessons not by my hand, and sometimes it gets really hard on my soul. At the same time no matter how hard it ever gets I will NEVER cry why me, or wish for another life, because all those little BIG moments in my life were the most beautiful, unforgettable treasures that were worth it all! Maybe the journey of the lessons brings us to the little BIG moments. I will give this my best, because I owe it to the gift I was giving, life......Yet it does not change the fact that I'm truly more terrified about this self work then anything else in my life. WOW.....that was a very honest feeling.      </p><picture>

I was in the Cape here this was the second year, and I finally talked at that time my wife into going. I had been well at this point for a couple of weeks for the first time in my life from P.T.S.D. it was gone! Should have been the happiest days of my life.

It had been 5 years I had been really sick with my wife. The morning I woke up and I knew I was well, I looked in her eyes, my soul dropped from my body, because she was gone. All her words said she was still hanging on, but her eyes they told the real story, and the horrific part of the whole thing is I could do nothing, but wait.

I have broken more people then I would like to think about, not because I wanted to, I just couldn't give what they were asking for. Sometimes it was the unfortunate case of being just an unhealthy relationship, and I needed to walk away. Then out of no where she walks through my door and as crazy as it sounds it was love at first site. I tried with everything that I'm made of to fight it, I even started a fight with her and told her not to talk to me any more. That did not work because we got married, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be married, yet be married to my soul mate. She was my everything, I had so many first feelings with her, I truly believed together no matter what came our way, we would always come out on top. I will spare you all the details, I will say Nov. age 40 she asked me for a divorce, there is no malevolent in her I don't blame her for leaving, yet I don't agree with it, we took vows, and how she left was just wrong. Needless to say this on top of a life of non stop surviving trauma a need to pause for a moment, because I can no longer find my go shoes, and that's scary as a hole full of spiders!</p>","metadata":{"starred":true}}]},"4be9ae78-5ede-4d65-936e-f42a062638ca":{"id":"4be9ae78-5ede-4d65-936e-f42a062638ca","index":3,"created_by":"2e331aff-81ef-4515-ab93-b9f2a432e8ab","updated_by":"2e331aff-81ef-4515-ab93-b9f2a432e8ab","created_at":"2016-03-14T02:46:05.171Z","updated_at":"2016-04-04T23:41:10.956Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-03-14-as-i-sit-here-in-the-extreme-quiet-of-this-lonely-house-fi.md","_title":"","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"as-i-sit-here-in-the-extreme-quiet-of-this-lonely-house-fi/index.html","inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"_description":"As I sit here in the extreme quiet of this lonely house, I find myself in very unfamiliar waters.

At the same time no matter how hard it ever gets I will NEVER cry why me, or wish for another life, because all those little BIG moments in my life were the most beautiful, unforgettable treasures that were worth it all! Maybe the journey of the lessons brings us to the little BIG moments. I will give this my best, because I owe it to the gift I was giving, life......Yet it does not change the fact that I'm truly more terrified about this self work then anything else in my life. WOW.....that was a very honest feeling.
