except the side wall you can't see. I tell you what this shop build has truly taken a lot out of me. I have tried to keep my stress to a small amount, and considering everything I have done pretty good. Yet being out of work
    and having to be really crafty on how to come up with supplies has almost drained me. I made the decision to walk away from my life with basically my truck, and my business equipment, that being said, I have had some curve balls thrown my way. So
    my equipment is not really stored in a weather tight conditions as of now. So this build has been extremely important to a point. On the other hand I can only do, what I can do. Truly, and honestly my back feels like it's never going to be right again,
    I'm so exhausted, yet seem to only get three hours sleep a night. I'm supposed to be resting, and letting my mind take a break, yet I cannot seem to be able to do that. I will keep marching on, yet my feet feel heavier than I can ever remember, and
    I don't know why, but I really believe that this is the way it is for me. It always has been, and I cannot see it changing. So ironic though everyone sees all these great things in me, and believe me, I do too. Yet this forever struggle, with only
    moments of air…I will take my hand, and I will play it. Yet if someone is listening, I could use a little help, a brake, pause….maybe just send me one, just one friend, you know the kind that's there through thick and thin, like oldskool I could REALLY
    use one right now bad. In the mean time weather that's answered or not I will keep on, keeping on.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="43"><!-- react-empty: 44 --></div></section><section id="section-v_BgCoverColumn2x-3ab58e2f-5f48-40af-adf7-2292a7ed5fd5" class="Section Section--components-2 color-bg color-title title-size-medium section-height-fullscreen section-bgcover-w p-0 text-align-center  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="45"><div class="Component fx-c j-c-end p-h-1 p-v-2 ls-p-v-8 ls-p-h-3 pos-r h-fs a-i-center t-a-c" data-reactid="46"><div class="Bg op-30" data-reactid="47"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="48"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="49"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/69974f81dd798211eb04b9f14fd6cc4b/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&amp;width=1383" style="object-position:80.95032312002893% 94.140625%;" data-reactid="50"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/be012c8fde404c77019923c5105e5609/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:80.95032312002893% 94.140625%;" data-reactid="51"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/237e5dcc5c2c2fc5376338858b75bc6a/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&amp;width=720" style="object-position:80.95032312002893% 94.140625%;" data-reactid="52"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b02baad499c91c4bb3b316761265c8c5/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&amp;width=360" style="object-position:80.95032312002893% 94.140625%;" data-reactid="53"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="1383" data-height="1466" data-ratio="0.9433833560709414" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/69974f81dd798211eb04b9f14fd6cc4b/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&amp;width=1383" style="object-position:80.95032312002893% 94.140625%;" data-reactid="54"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 ls-p-2 max-w-560px color-title h-100p" data-reactid="55"><!-- react-empty: 56 --><!-- react-empty: 57 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="58"><h1 data-reactid="59"><span class="" data-reactid="60"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="61">Sometimes Letting Go Is The Only Healthy Move. 8-9-2016</span></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 62 --><!-- react-empty: 63 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="64"><p>You know when one gets, sick, with a mental illness, in my case P.T.S.D. You come to realize that the people who you called your best friends and family can’t, or don't want to deal with it. Your made to feel like a deceased person who is no longer wanted around. Yet out of the 20 or so a couple manage to still come around once in awhile. This I guess hit me exceptionally hard because so many times in my life I have been abandoned. Now it happened all over again, and now again with the Divorce. My ex wife desided she was no longer in love with me in November 2015. It took me a bit longer to put that behind me. Yet in the pass of couple months I have came to a really ok place with it. I have had to come to some hard realizations, and things are for the best. So lets get back to basics I thought I could get my Best Friend back now (my x wife) We meet, have some pretty deep, pretty great conversation. She states how much of a great time she had, great! I had asked about a statement she made when she said I was the one pushing for the divorce thats why she rushed it through. I asked does that mean you wanted to give the seperation a while first. In true form, her answer is ding ding ding I can't answer that question. So what do I do try to support her feelings, and be that great friend we once were. What does she do….I'm not ready to be friends yet. Wow what a blow…one I just don't understand, she's not in love with me, states she wants our friendship back, I'm now in a great place to do that, and BAM! It's like the heart aches all over again, yet different, but holy cow I cannot take it anymore. I have done all I can, above and beyond, to mend whatever I could, and I playing the fool am the only one same as the marriage who is left giving a shit. So I have told her no more, don't contact me, phone, letter, or through someone else. Blocked numbers, and that's the way it has to be. I know that I'm a over sensitive person, and it sometimes controls my actions, but I'm working on that right now very hard. At the same time I have to protect myself from people who don't care to take a moment to release how there actions effect me. I need to stop giving all and getting nothing. Not to say that is a everything statement. Yet I have a couple of friends who have stuck around and I love them for that. Yet it's to hard, when the only time they want to hang is at there house, and talk about my life. I want to have fun, hang with my friends, go places, do things. I see them do it with everyone else, why not me? Plus it's all connected to my x wife, somehow I just feel like I'm always on display, like what is she going to do next, or something like that. Then is what truly and I mean truly kills me is I have bonded with a child like never before, and I have to lose that too. So much loss, so much hurt, I know it will ease up one day, and I'm waiting, in the meantime I will keep working on me, and not be better, or angry, because for some reason there is a lesson in all this, and a purpose, yet my heart is very heavy. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing, but I do know that I have to protect myself from continuing to get hurt by the people I care for most. It may not be the right way, but at this point in time it's the only way I know. So many shades of gray, and I just need to find peace in one of them. It just really hurts right now, and it's okay, because I need to feel it.</p></div></div></div><div class="Component fx-c j-c-end p-h-1 p-v-2 ls-p-v-8 ls-p-h-3 pos-r h-fs a-i-center t-a-c" data-reactid="65"><div class="Bg op-30" data-reactid="66"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="67"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="68"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a868c614d0494d332aa45d9c2b0fbdf2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F19321611-80f3-4016-864a-32305ce80736.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:94.3359375% 66.30859375%;" data-reactid="69"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/539b3587a83673e1f5f27648078cad6e/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F19321611-80f3-4016-864a-32305ce80736.jpg&amp;width=1280" style="object-position:94.3359375% 66.30859375%;" data-reactid="70"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/40dfa24a910a8aa2bb8e2c90cca46f4c/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F19321611-80f3-4016-864a-32305ce80736.jpg&amp;width=720" style="object-position:94.3359375% 66.30859375%;" data-reactid="71"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/40d5e992ab0f0baa11cc41d28abd7175/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F19321611-80f3-4016-864a-32305ce80736.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:94.3359375% 66.30859375%;" data-reactid="72"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="2976" data-height="2976" data-ratio="1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/a868c614d0494d332aa45d9c2b0fbdf2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F19321611-80f3-4016-864a-32305ce80736.jpg&amp;width=1440" style="object-position:94.3359375% 66.30859375%;" data-reactid="73"/></picture></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 ls-p-2 max-w-560px color-title h-100p" data-reactid="74"><!-- react-empty: 75 --><!-- react-empty: 76 --><!-- react-empty: 77 --><!-- react-empty: 78 --><div class="m-b-05" data-reactid="79"><!-- react-text: 80 --> <!-- /react-text --><div class="Paragraph Caption m-t-1 l-h-m  " data-reactid="81"><p data-reactid="82">THE SHOP</p></div><a href="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/19321611-80f3-4016-864a-32305ce80736.jpg" class=" " data-reactid="83"><!-- react-empty: 84 --></a><div class="Attribution op-60 undefined" data-reactid="85"><h5 data-reactid="86"><span class="Author" data-reactid="87"><span>Mindy Tsolina  July 9, 2016</span></span></h5></div><!-- react-empty: 88 --></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="89"><p>You know when one gets, sick, with a mental illness, in my case P.T.S.D.

Then is what truly and I mean truly kills me is I have bonded with a child like never before, and I have to lose that too. So much loss, so much hurt, I know it will ease up one day, and I'm waiting, in the meantime I will keep working on me, and not be better, or angry, because for some reason there is a lesson in all this, and a purpose, yet my heart is very heavy. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing, but I do know that I have to protect myself from continuing to get hurt by the people I care for most. It may not be the right way, but at this point in time it's the only way I know. So many shades of gray, and I just need to find peace in one of them. It just really hurts right now, and it's okay, because I need to feel it.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_Ghosted2x-e5e6430b-3ab3-4427-a30d-ba2f63583d40" class="Section

Now keep in mind I had no choice, but to do this to keep my house and life paid for. I'm very proud to say I did it! By myself with no help and no interest or concern from the people who said they loved me. Lesson...Do what makes you happy, because in the end you cannot and I mean cannot make someone else happy. That's on them. I was under the crazy illusion marriage ment forever and forever ment your a team. I didn't know that included Cliff Haven and CVPH. I guess you never truly know a person, and promise has a 5 year shelf life. Lesson I'm a fantastic person I do what I say, and stand by my promises, I whole heartily deserve the very same thing. Someone who wants to be my partner, not fit in all the so called social clubs. Soon they will be gone to.

</picture><h1>At age 40 this picture has come to mean so much to me, I always feel like there is a storm coming, yet I know that the storm is the soul cleanser. So the rainbow is right around the next turn. I also know that at this point in my life, it will be the hardest time, and challenge when it comes to having a healthy mind and body. I'm finding myself asking questions like, why are you doing this to yourself? I don't think I know hardly anybody that doesn't self medicate in one way or another to numb their problems away. Bad day at work, get drunk, my back hurts, pop a pill, it's the weekend, let's party, and I choose to feel, feel it ALL every single ounce of pain, with eyes wide open....In the very less traveled road of truly getting healthy. Oddly enough it's also not the "cool" thing to do, and EVERYONE will tell you all the time what YOUR doing wrong. Meanwhile, as this chapter in my life comes to a close, the sadness is such a heavy feeling for me. I'm left feeling extremely misunderstood, unwilling to trust anyone, a whole lot of wasted investments, yet I have learned the biggest lessons of my life, I'm not bitter, I wouldn't change a thing, but WOW people have blown my mind like never before in the past. I was raised with pure evil, at least then I always knew where the people were I could see that they were to hurt me. In the past six months, this was totally way worst beast, you don't even see them coming, Bad Form! I have been told lies right to my face for no other reason, but they were looking out for themselves. The really crazy thing is, after spending 10 years with me first and foremost, if you know anything about me, you KNOW I would never do things any of the things said people were so concerned about. It disgust me truly to my core, how one month you can tell someone how in love with them you are, and the very next month your asking them if they are going to get you for abandonmeof the home. I would eat out of a garbage can before I let my X wife pay me monthly money.......Outrageous!!!!! That's what they say,and I say they because I couldn't just do this privately with my wife and I, in true form I had to do this with the parents too. Yet that is what they were focused on She gets the house, we paid 111,000 its worth 145,000 the work was (90% done by me) Parents buy for 125,000. They keep telling me it's a GREAT deal, I'm so sick, so beat down I can't even fight it anymore, . 1/4 of a brain knows who gets the shit end of the stix. The way I pockit games, I don't do. Shocked by it <a href="http://all.here" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all.here</a> is a time I relize actions all love or no love I deserve so much more from a partner in life! I deserve to be loved with the same deep forever love I once gave....next few the will be I hmuch more on the sunny side On to the next chapter!</h1></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="208"><!-- react-empty: 209 --></div></section><section id="section-v_Title-becc928a-4c9f-401c-9f61-041e78b841b3" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-xxlarge p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="210"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="211"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 m-a" data-reactid="212"><!-- react-empty: 213 --><!-- react-empty: 214 --><div class="System-font ls-max-w-0 Headline" data-reactid="215"><h1 data-reactid="216"><span class="" data-reactid="217"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="218">HOLY PIG EARS!!

Yet believe or not you would think that would be trying, but that was only the beginning. I have had to move my things multiple times to multiple places, I found a place to live finally and only slept there 11 days, and it turned into a disaster, and I have moved everything yet again. So this is where I&#x27;m at in life......you just have to laugh a lot and stay focused on your dream/goals, and relax your soul. Really, it sounds like I read it in a card, but seriously, I came up with that all on my own!!!! SO I WILL START FROM GROUND ZERO, TO GET TO MY TINY HOUSE!

It truly brakes me every time. Yet I can look at a photo and it's like I'm there, and can recall every moment. I was 22 in this picture, having the time of my life! I was very much involved with the outrages club scene. [AKA MIND-A-LATER] The only thing on my agenda for every night and day was to <gs>outdo</gs> the crazy fun time I had the day before! On this day I was at my <gs>mother's</gs> house very nervous because I had made a real commitment to someone, and that <gs>someone</gs> was a girl<gs>. </gs><gs>Sure, I</gs> had messed around with girls, yet no one knew, at least not my friends that I had been going to school with since the first grade, and not my parents. I even brought my new girlfriend along to meet my mom, and then I had her leave before I told her. I remember skimming that pool that day for two hours straight, it was already clean. I was so nervous, my hands were dripping. I'm sitting on the diving board of the pool, when I finally built up the courage my mother was on the other side of the pool in a lounge chair laying in the sun, with her <gs>sunglasses</gs> on. I said,"Mom you know the girl that was here?" She said,"Yes". Me, "Well, she is my girlfriend". As I took a big gulp in my throat feeling like I was going to meet some sort of end of I don't know what. She said,"I know." I said,"No mom like we are dating kind of girlfriend."She said,"Mindy I know that, I have known that since you were six years old, I'm your mother."Well, at that moment I didn't know if I should be happy, or if I should have walked over and wring her neck! I said,"MOM! If you knew this whole f#*#@*g time, why in the hell did you not share it with me!!!" All I could think of is all the years of shame, pain, and I had no one to talk to. She said,"I knew you would tell me when you were ready." Well My mother and I then had years of very hard life to work out, and I was already angry at her for a world of shit I had no way of sorting through at that time, so unfortunately for her that was one more thing for me to add to the very high mountain of Mindy's your not right list for her mother. Looking back I see things MUCH differently about that day, My mother was the one that loved me for who I was, and being gay meant NOTHING to her. She got over that when I wouldn't play with dolls, yet fell in love with my dirt bike at age six. So that's the beginning of my coming out story, I spoke of this because it reminded me of something that an <gs>ongoing</gs> situation with a once best friend flared up again yesterday. It was going to happen, I just hoped with all that I am It would not have. I'm hoping by the end of this after three years of being totally heartbroken over it, I can find peace and a pocket to put it in. So back to when I was 22, okay mom knows one down only the rest of Orlando to go....I have lived with my roommate and best friend for the past three years, I truly love her, and we have the BEST of times together [I wish more than anything that I could find you] she is a Jersey girl, yet I did not think she would have taken it the way she did. At first she was mad and shocked,"You're not gay you get the hottest guys falling all over you every night, and they keep coming BACK she screamed! Your THE-MIND-A-LATER the PIMP are you f#####g crazy!!!"Then she say's,"Mindy this chic better be hot, if you bring home a bull dike I will kill you!" I wanted to laugh so hard, yet I couldn't because she was dead serious. Not about the killing part, but I think in her mind the only way she could be okay with it is if I somehow kept a part of who I was, meaning if I had arm candy, and it was a girl well in Orlando at that time I could still maintain my social status and get what I want. I was 10 steps ahead, no way was I coming out of the closet and publicly displaying a commitment to a girl, without her being a total 10. No Worries there, now healthy that was not considered and I was too young and dumb to know any better. This was my first real relationship would be doomed no matter what. Nevertheless, my good buddy got through it, it took her a bit of adjustment, but in the end she loved me just the same, and we remained very close for years, until we lose touch. Now is what really took me back was the ones I didn't even see it coming, it just side swiped me, and my back was on the floor. Take my friend that I had through out school. Wow, we did some amazing things together, like renting a convertible white, red top Mustang and went from Orlando to the Giants stadium in N.Y. City, back down to South Beach Miami baby!!! Why you ask.... To follow Metallica with G & R opening up for them, yes, it was amazing, saw them 8 times in a week if I remember correctly! Also ate some spaghetti with Jason one night backstage. Little BIG moments!!! So we had major history, roommates, she even flew to N.Y. My senior year to visit me for a week. I think telling her no big deal. Call her, tell her, and she said,"you're disgusting, I can't believe you do that!" we never spoke again. There were a few like that, fear of what you don't understand, I think, or maybe fear of something they saw in them self's. I don't think I will ever really know, yet I will never forget the hurt, and feeling of being tossed out like garbage like I had felt so many times as a child............ THAT"S IT!!!!! What an ah ha moment, that's when the deep seed of feeling jaded by people was planted, I mean the seed I carried with me from childhood all the time, but that's when I planted it!!!! When I invested in people, I did that like I do everything else...<gs>.</gs>I gave everything! This is a TRIP, because I forgot this. I could not understand how people that were so bonded with me, could just turn like that, as if they had just <gs>meet</gs> me a week ago, and we were sitting in Mrs. <gs>Adams 4th grade class</gs> together, that's how far back we went! How those peaces just would not fit together for me. That's when I took a long hard look around, and said to myself,"If the people you grow with, are willing to turn on you like that, no one can ever be fully trusted, sooner or much later they will disappoint, or seek to hurt you." This is pretty heavy....<gs>.</gs>To Be Continued<gs>...</gs>Okay I've had some time to chew on that, I'm still floored yet I think I'm able to find some words now. So I'm a pretty jaded person when it comes to people, I almost always see everyone with a raised eyebrow until proven different. I really dislike this quality in myself, yet somehow I'm unfortunately almost always right. I just chalked it up to my childhood, yet it only started there the real pain and <gs>heart ache</gs> came when I thought I had my family behind and created a new real support system. I CAN NOT believe I forgot this! Back then my friends were my world, I had so many people around me, and we were tight! I Loved them and they Loved me, I gave them my all. Then when the few reacted the way they did about me being gay, it changed me, to what I am now. <gs>Also every</gs> time I did give someone a little trust, and they ended up hurting me, well add more green to the Jade please. Sorry I'm sure this post is very boring, yet for me it truly is a huge deal.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_BgCoverColumn-a59febf4-2c1f-4acc-b528-77aea6b3270b" class="Section

In my life time I have not seen the seven wonders of the world.....yet I have been so very lucky to most always have my eyes truly open to all the beauty right ate my feet where ever I'm lucky enough to land. I'm being forced to learn so much about myself in this long time of solitude, like I never new I was truly an introvert, and I don't really if ever I express how I honestly feel to others, that includes my soon to be X wife. I had no real conception of how guarded I have lived my whole life, I can honestly say I have been so miss handled from early childhood through out my young adulthood that I consciously think I trust a few people. Now I have learned that subconsciously I have never trusted anyone my whole life. Now that IS A LITTLE BIG MOMENT!!!!!!</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_VideoColumn-d6468ab8-233c-4321-a55a-a8594f9ad24a" class="Section Section--components-1 p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 title-size-small color-title section-bgcover-wo  color-bg text-align-center  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="293"><div class="Component p-1 ls-fx-r " data-reactid="294"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 w-100p ls-w-75p" data-reactid="295"><div class="Cover ov-h pos-r" data-reactid="296"><button class="color-bg color-title pos-a circle w-4rem h-4rem center-hv m-0 cur-p bx-sh-soft" data-reactid="297"><span class="center-hv pos-a w-1rem h-1rem" data-reactid="298"><svg version="1.1" id="Layer_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="409.7 414 32.1 34.5" enable-background="new 409.7 414 32.1 34.5" xml:space="preserve"><polygon class="color-icon-pop" fill="#fff" points="418.6,448.5 441.8,431.3 418.6,414 "/></svg></span></button><img class="cur-p" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/71af21765f41068d1ae0ed8c5c193099/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fe1b062e65061698c79875a27e98297e1bd92b04c.jpg&amp;width=961" style="object-position:42.53381893860562% 50.520833333333336%;" data-reactid="299"/></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 w-100p ls-w-25p" data-reactid="300"><!-- react-empty: 301 --><!-- react-empty: 302 --><!-- react-empty: 303 --><div class="max-w-560px m-a" data-reactid="304"><!-- react-text: 305 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-empty: 306 --><a href="https://youtu.be/sas_H2yTiVo" class=" " data-reactid="307"><h3 class="m-t-1 m-b-1 font-title undefined" data-reactid="308"><span data-reactid="309">AGH - Yummy (DJ Sandy Electro Dub)</span></h3></a><div class="Attribution op-60 undefined" data-reactid="310"><h5 data-reactid="311"><span class="Author" data-reactid="312"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a></span></h5></div><!-- react-empty: 313 --></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="314"><p>This is D.J.

I made the decision to walk away from my life with basically my truck, and my business equipment, that being said, I have had some curve balls thrown my way. So my equipment is not really stored in a weather tight conditions as of now. So this build has been extremely important to a point. On the other hand I can only do, what I can do. Truly, and honestly my back feels like it's never going to be right again, I'm so exhausted, yet seem to only get three hours sleep a night. I'm supposed to be resting, and letting my mind take a break, yet I cannot seem to be able to do that. I will keep marching on, yet my feet feel heavier than I can ever remember, and I don't know why, but I really believe that this is the way it is for me. It always has been, and I cannot see it changing. So ironic though everyone sees all these great things in me, and believe me, I do too. Yet this forever struggle, with only moments of air…I will take my hand, and I will play it. Yet if someone is listening, I could use a little help, a brake, pause….maybe just send me one, just one friend, you know the kind that's there through thick and thin, like oldskool I could REALLY use one right now bad. In the mean time weather that's answered or not I will keep on, keeping on.","via":{}},"content":[{"id":"c78eb07a-337d-43fd-8fb4-4857ab6ccc75","item":"7103e012-6134-4014-910c-014d01da989e","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2016-08-15T01:52:07.523Z","_caption":"Ground Zero...","_html":"<img src=\"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e0a5a15d-fd99-4ac4-b655-5fb3d7d25a25.jpg\" alt=\"Ground Zero...\">","metadata":{"starred":true,"_description":"","_caption":"Ground Zero...","keywords":[]},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8c60f17a3564462a2b6520ef6176dfa1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe0a5a15d-fd99-4ac4-b655-5fb3d7d25a25.jpg&width=1440","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e0a5a15d-fd99-4ac4-b655-5fb3d7d25a25.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e0a5a15d-fd99-4ac4-b655-5fb3d7d25a25.jpg","pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8c60f17a3564462a2b6520ef6176dfa1/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe0a5a15d-fd99-4ac4-b655-5fb3d7d25a25.jpg&width=1440"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/64fa84aa25e5cd21f1184c63428030ec/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe0a5a15d-fd99-4ac4-b655-5fb3d7d25a25.jpg&width=1280"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f6df46404e585ac12ad0242dd761f278/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe0a5a15d-fd99-4ac4-b655-5fb3d7d25a25.jpg&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/8c8b980ab1084361711fcd51ab43f942/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fe0a5a15d-fd99-4ac4-b655-5fb3d7d25a25.jpg&width=360"}],"resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/39e4b9ba181374afc17dc6f22cc5c716.png","ratio":"64:33","aspect":1.9393939393939394,"orientation":"landscape","width":1440,"height":743,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"colors":[[3,5,2],[26,42,65],[143,122,95],[255,255,255],[86,65,34]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[265.78125,37.96875],[1362.65625,725.625]],"confidence":0.227445,"center":[818.4375,396.5625],"radius":570.1471875},"exif":{"exif":{"image":{"ImageHeight":743,"ExifOffset":152,"ModifyDate":"2016:08:14 20:56:40","ImageWidth":1440,"Make":"Z Camera","Orientation":1,"LightSource":[],"SceneCaptureType":[],"MeteringMode":65535},"thumbnail":{},"exif":{"ThumbnailOffset":182,"ThumbnailLength":[]},"gps":{},"interoperability":{},"makernote":{}}}}},{"id":"74c363fa-6dbd-4e38-b8ae-a913d4022ef6","item":"7103e012-6134-4014-910c-014d01da989e","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-15T01:52:07.523Z","updated_at":null,"_text":"Well the shell is almost done except the side wall you can't see.

Yet out of the 20 or so a couple manage to still come around once in awhile. This I guess hit me exceptionally hard because so many times in my life I have been abandoned. Now it happened all over again, and now again with the Divorce. My ex wife desided she was no longer in love with me in November 2015. It took me a bit longer to put that behind me. Yet in the pass of couple months I have came to a really ok place with it. I have had to come to some hard realizations, and things are for the best. So lets get back to basics I thought I could get my Best Friend back now (my x wife) We meet, have some pretty deep, pretty great conversation. She states how much of a great time she had, great! I had asked about a statement she made when she said I was the one pushing for the divorce thats why she rushed it through. I asked does that mean you wanted to give the seperation a while first. In true form, her answer is ding ding ding I can't answer that question. So what do I do try to support her feelings, and be that great friend we once were. What does she do….I'm not ready to be friends yet. Wow what a blow…one I just don't understand, she's not in love with me, states she wants our friendship back, I'm now in a great place to do that, and BAM! It's like the heart aches all over again, yet different, but holy cow I cannot take it anymore. I have done all I can, above and beyond, to mend whatever I could, and I playing the fool am the only one same as the marriage who is left giving a shit. So I have told her no more, don't contact me, phone, letter, or through someone else. Blocked numbers, and that's the way it has to be. I know that I'm a over sensitive person, and it sometimes controls my actions, but I'm working on that right now very hard. At the same time I have to protect myself from people who don't care to take a moment to release how there actions effect me. I need to stop giving all and getting nothing. Not to say that is a everything statement. Yet I have a couple of friends who have stuck around and I love them for that. Yet it's to hard, when the only time they want to hang is at there house, and talk about my life. I want to have fun, hang with my friends, go places, do things. I see them do it with everyone else, why not me? Plus it's all connected to my x wife, somehow I just feel like I'm always on display, like what is she going to do next, or something like that. Then is what truly and I mean truly kills me is I have bonded with a child like never before, and I have to lose that too. So much loss, so much hurt, I know it will ease up one day, and I'm waiting, in the meantime I will keep working on me, and not be better, or angry, because for some reason there is a lesson in all this, and a purpose, yet my heart is very heavy. I don't know if I'm doing the right thing, but I do know that I have to protect myself from continuing to get hurt by the people I care for most. It may not be the right way, but at this point in time it's the only way I know. So many shades of gray, and I just need to find peace in one of them. It just really hurts right now, and it's okay, because I need to feel it.","title":"Sometimes Letting Go Is The Only Healthy Move. 8-9-2016","via":{}},"content":[{"id":"c124263a-e75d-4a41-abfe-bf9013be677f","item":"3ab58e2f-5f48-40af-adf7-2292a7ed5fd5","type":"h1","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-13T18:38:35.221Z","updated_at":null,"_text":"Sometimes Letting Go Is The Only Healthy Move. 8-9-2016","_html":"<h1>Sometimes Letting Go Is The Only Healthy Move. 8-9-2016</h1>","metadata":{"starred":true}},{"id":"1406a553-ccc4-435f-ba0b-b222e0a5677d","item":"3ab58e2f-5f48-40af-adf7-2292a7ed5fd5","type":"image","created_at":null,"updated_at":"2016-08-13T18:38:35.221Z","_html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/69974f81dd798211eb04b9f14fd6cc4b/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&width=1383\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/be012c8fde404c77019923c5105e5609/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&width=1280\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/237e5dcc5c2c2fc5376338858b75bc6a/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&width=720\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b02baad499c91c4bb3b316761265c8c5/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&width=360\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/69974f81dd798211eb04b9f14fd6cc4b/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&width=1383\">\n</picture>\n","metadata":{"starred":true,"_description":"","keywords":[]},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/69974f81dd798211eb04b9f14fd6cc4b/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&width=1383","original":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png","imgflosrc":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png","pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/69974f81dd798211eb04b9f14fd6cc4b/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&width=1383"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/be012c8fde404c77019923c5105e5609/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&width=1280"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/237e5dcc5c2c2fc5376338858b75bc6a/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b02baad499c91c4bb3b316761265c8c5/passthrough.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F8b6ba1e137c73266a02b772129cf582e8eff393f.png&width=360"}],"resized":"http://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/caliper-resized/d69e88ca07e880163279de32589e4ff7.png","ratio":"483:512","aspect":0.943359375,"orientation":"portrait","width":1383,"height":1466,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"faces":[{"x":1100.931640625,"y":1361.490234375,"width":37.22265625,"height":37.22265625,"confidence":5.025588},{"x":1052.255859375,"y":1384.396484375,"width":47.244140625,"height":47.244140625,"confidence":4.998713}],"colors":[[255,255,255],[2,0,0],[253,255,0],[125,130,128],[187,0,0]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[81.603515625,309.234375],[1338.583984375,1464.568359375]],"confidence":0.169195,"center":[714.388671875,818.8984375],"radius":697.117359375},"exif":{"exif":{}}}},{"id":"df6dcdfc-0a92-45ee-9fae-fb5e583e0155","item":"3ab58e2f-5f48-40af-adf7-2292a7ed5fd5","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":"2016-08-13T18:38:35.221Z","updated_at":null,"_text":"You know when one gets, sick, with a mental illness, in my case P.T.S.D.

It may not be the right way, but at this point in time it's the only way I know. So many shades of gray, and I just need to find peace in one of them. It just really hurts right now, and it's okay, because I need to feel it.</p>","metadata":{"starred":true}}]},"5157b230-ba13-4eb0-abfc-61b38a1a25c2":{"id":"5157b230-ba13-4eb0-abfc-61b38a1a25c2","index":5,"created_by":"2e331aff-81ef-4515-ab93-b9f2a432e8ab","updated_by":"2e331aff-81ef-4515-ab93-b9f2a432e8ab","created_at":"2016-07-09T16:14:19.311Z","updated_at":"2016-07-09T17:07:11.119Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-07-09-well-its-coming-alongi-have-been-teaching-myself-balanc.md","_title":"","metadata":{"@type":"Article","isBasedOnUrl":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/19321611-80f3-4016-864a-32305ce80736.jpg","starred":false,"inFeed":true,"_description":"Well it's coming along....I have been teaching myself balance during this build.

I was very much involved with the outrages club scene. [AKA MIND-A-LATER] The only thing on my agenda for every night and day was to outdo the crazy fun time I had the day before! On this day I was at my mother's house very nervous because I had made a real commitment to someone, and that someone was a girl. Sure, I had messed around with girls, yet no one knew, at least not my friends that I had been going to school with since the first grade, and not my parents. I even brought my new girlfriend along to meet my mom, and then I had her leave before I told her. I remember skimming that pool that day for two hours straight, it was already clean. I was so nervous, my hands were dripping. I'm sitting on the diving board of the pool, when I finally built up the courage my mother was on the other side of the pool in a lounge chair laying in the sun, with her sunglasses on. I said,\"Mom you know the girl that was here?\" She said,\"Yes\". Me, \"Well, she is my girlfriend\". As I took a big gulp in my throat feeling like I was going to meet some sort of end of I don't know what. She said,\"I know.\" I said,\"No mom like we are dating kind of girlfriend.\"She said,\"Mindy I know that, I have known that since you were six years old, I'm your mother.\"Well, at that moment I didn't know if I should be happy, or if I should have walked over and wring her neck! I said,\"MOM! If you knew this whole f#*#@*g time, why in the hell did you not share it with me!!!\" All I could think of is all the years of shame, pain, and I had no one to talk to. She said,\"I knew you would tell me when you were ready.\" Well My mother and I then had years of very hard life to work out, and I was already angry at her for a world of shit I had no way of sorting through at that time, so unfortunately for her that was one more thing for me to add to the very high mountain of Mindy's your not right list for her mother. Looking back I see things MUCH differently about that day, My mother was the one that loved me for who I was, and being gay meant NOTHING to her. She got over that when I wouldn't play with dolls, yet fell in love with my dirt bike at age six. So that's the beginning of my coming out story, I spoke of this because it reminded me of something that an ongoing situation with a once best friend flared up again yesterday. It was going to happen, I just hoped with all that I am It would not have. I'm hoping by the end of this after three years of being totally heartbroken over it, I can find peace and a pocket to put it in. So back to when I was 22, okay mom knows one down only the rest of Orlando to go....I have lived with my roommate and best friend for the past three years, I truly love her, and we have the BEST of times together [I wish more than anything that I could find you] she is a Jersey girl, yet I did not think she would have taken it the way she did. At first she was mad and shocked,\"You're not gay you get the hottest guys falling all over you every night, and they keep coming BACK she screamed! Your THE-MIND-A-LATER the PIMP are you f#####g crazy!!!\"Then she say's,\"Mindy this chic better be hot, if you bring home a bull dike I will kill you!\" I wanted to laugh so hard, yet I couldn't because she was dead serious. Not about the killing part, but I think in her mind the only way she could be okay with it is if I somehow kept a part of who I was, meaning if I had arm candy, and it was a girl well in Orlando at that time I could still maintain my social status and get what I want. I was 10 steps ahead, no way was I coming out of the closet and publicly displaying a commitment to a girl, without her being a total 10. No Worries there, now healthy that was not considered and I was too young and dumb to know any better. This was my first real relationship would be doomed no matter what. Nevertheless, my good buddy got through it, it took her a bit of adjustment, but in the end she loved me just the same, and we remained very close for years, until we lose touch. Now is what really took me back was the ones I didn't even see it coming, it just side swiped me, and my back was on the floor. Take my friend that I had through out school. Wow, we did some amazing things together, like renting a convertible white, red top Mustang and went from Orlando to the Giants stadium in N.Y. City, back down to South Beach Miami baby!!! Why you ask.... To follow Metallica with G & R opening up for them, yes, it was amazing, saw them 8 times in a week if I remember correctly! Also ate some spaghetti with Jason one night backstage. Little BIG moments!!! So we had major history, roommates, she even flew to N.Y. My senior year to visit me for a week. I think telling her no big deal. Call her, tell her, and she said,\"you're disgusting, I can't believe you do that!\" we never spoke again. There were a few like that, fear of what you don't understand, I think, or maybe fear of something they saw in them self's. I don't think I will ever really know, yet I will never forget the hurt, and feeling of being tossed out like garbage like I had felt so many times as a child............ THAT\"S IT!!!!! What an ah ha moment, that's when the deep seed of feeling jaded by people was planted, I mean the seed I carried with me from childhood all the time, but that's when I planted it!!!! When I invested in people, I did that like I do everything else....I gave everything! This is a TRIP, because I forgot this. I could not understand how people that were so bonded with me, could just turn like that, as if they had just meet me a week ago, and we were sitting in Mrs. Adams 4th grade class together, that's how far back we went! How those peaces just would not fit together for me. That's when I took a long hard look around, and said to myself,\"If the people you grow with, are willing to turn on you like that, no one can ever be fully trusted, sooner or much later they will disappoint, or seek to hurt you.\" This is pretty heavy.....To Be Continued...Okay I've had some time to chew on that, I'm still floored yet I think I'm able to find some words now. So I'm a pretty jaded person when it comes to people, I almost always see everyone with a raised eyebrow until proven different. I really dislike this quality in myself, yet somehow I'm unfortunately almost always right. I just chalked it up to my childhood, yet it only started there the real pain and heart ache came when I thought I had my family behind and created a new real support system. I CAN NOT believe I forgot this! Back then my friends were my world, I had so many people around me, and we were tight! I Loved them and they Loved me, I gave them my all. Then when the few reacted the way they did about me being gay, it changed me, to what I am now. Also every time I did give someone a little trust, and they ended up hurting me, well add more green to the Jade please. Sorry I'm sure this post is very boring, yet for me it truly is a huge deal.","title":"Coming Out Day-age 22","keywords":[],"publisher":{"name":"Live","domain":"onedrive.live.com","url":"https://onedrive.live.com","favicon":"https://onedrive.live.com/favicon.ico"}},"content":[{"id":"b56b637d-8ba1-46fa-b93f-225619a11ccd","item":"02fa9dc9-6601-4f43-a0f2-5e2554940455","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"It's so very odd to me that I cannot remember basic things, and so many people come up to me and talk to me like they have known me their whole life and I have no idea who they are.
