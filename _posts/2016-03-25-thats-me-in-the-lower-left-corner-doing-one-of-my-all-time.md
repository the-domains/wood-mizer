  That's me in the lower left corner doing one of my all time favorite things,
  beach combing. I look at this picture with great emotion that fills me up so
  much my whole body is shaking, At that moment I was so lost, and horrified at
  what I new was going to be the inevitable, yet was powerless to stop it. I was
  in the Cape here this was the second year, and I finally talked at that time
  my wife into going. I had been well at this point for a couple of weeks for
  the first time in my life from P.T.S.D. it was gone! Should have been the
  happiest days of my life. Yet let me tell you, when your eyes open for the
  first time in your life, and EVERYTHING, slows down to about 10 MPH, rather
  than the 115 MPH you have been traveling for 30 yearsâ€¦..FUCK ME!!! It had been
  5 years I had been really sick with my wife. The morning I woke up and I knew
  I was well, I looked in her eyes, my soul dropped from my body, because she
  was gone. All her words said she was still hanging on, but her eyes they told
  the real story, and the horrific part of the whole thing is I could do
  nothing, but wait. Wait the longest year 1/2 of my life until her mouth told
  me, what her eyes already had.
