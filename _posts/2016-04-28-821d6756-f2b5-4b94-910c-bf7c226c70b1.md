title: "My business was doing in my opinion extremely successful. The first year of full time work my gross income of a soul P. was 32,000. With zero help, zero support,  and everyone close to me telling me I was crazy, irresponsible, and I even had one supposedly best friend, tell me if I were  (my x wife) I would divorce you. Now keep in mind I had no choice, but to do this to keep my house and life paid for. I'm very proud to say I did it! By myself with no help and no interest or concern from the people who said they loved me. Lesson...Do what makes you happy, because in the end you cannot and I mean cannot make someone else happy. That's on them. I was under the crazy illusion marriage ment forever and forever ment your a team. I didn't know that included Cliff Haven and CVPH. I guess you never truly know a person, and promise has a 5 year shelf life. Lesson I'm a fantastic person I do what I say, and stand by my promises, I whole heartily deserve the very same thing. Someone who wants to be my partner, not fit in all the so called social clubs. Soon they will be gone to. What can I say I gave all and got dooped...it's ok, another great lesson, people who you think are true....double check and then check again. "
