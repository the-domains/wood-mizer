title: "HOLY PIG EARS!! Life is truly a roller coaster....I have in the last 10 months lost my wife, my house, dog, business, and health......Now it sounds like a very sad country song believe me I know! Yet believe or not you would think that would be trying, but that was only the beginning. I have had to move my things multiple times to multiple places, I found a place to live finally and only slept there 11 days, and it turned into a disaster, and I have moved everything yet again. So this is where I'm at in life......you just have to laugh a lot and stay focused on your dream/goals, and relax your soul. Really, it sounds like I read it in a card, but seriously, I came up with that all on my own!!!! SO I WILL START FROM GROUND ZERO, TO GET TO MY TINY HOUSE! It's exciting! "
