description: "I remember in my teens the only thing that brought my mind to a still place was the ocean. Sometimes I would be on my board with oldskool legendary friends counting each others cutbacks. Other days I would come in from a session and my mouth perched with salt water, slice open my mango with my teeth, and every time it was like the first mango I had ever ate. Or we would scrap our money together and pick up live lobsters on the way with a stick of butter, and a loaf of french bread. Fire up the charcoal, add the lobsters, and head out for a few sets. when we got back in it was a surfer feast! How I love to miss those days, and what I wouldn't do to see my old mates again, truly those days were the happiest days of my life!"
