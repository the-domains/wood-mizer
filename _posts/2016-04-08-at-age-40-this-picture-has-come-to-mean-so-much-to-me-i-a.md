At age 40 this picture has come to mean so much to me, I always feel like there is a storm coming, yet I know that the storm is the soul cleanser. So the rainbow is right around the next turn. I also know that at this point in my life, it will be the hardest when it comes to having a healthy mind and body. I'm finding myself asking questions like, why are you doing this to yourself? I don't think I know hardly anybody that doesn't self medicate in one way or another to numb their problems away.

Oddly enough it's also not the "cool" thing to do, and EVERYONE will tell you all the time what YOUR doing wrong.  Meanwhile, as this chapter in my life comes to a close, the sadness is so heavy for me. I'm left feeling  extremelymisunderstood, unwilling to trust anyone,  a whole lot of wasted investments, yet I have learned the biggest lessons of my life, I'm not bitter, I would'nt change a thing, but WOW people have blown my mind like never before in the past.Six months I was raised with pure evil, at least with that I always knew where the people were that were going to hurt me.
