title: "At age 40 this picture has come to mean so much to me, I always feel like there is a storm coming, yet I know that the storm is the soul cleanser. So the rainbow is right around the next turn. I also know that at this point in my life, it will be the hardest time, and challenge when it comes to having a healthy mind and body. I'm finding myself asking questions like, why are you doing this to yourself? I don't think I know hardly anybody that doesn't self medicate in one way or another to numb their problems away. Bad day at work, get drunk, my back hurts, pop a pill, it's the weekend, let's party, and I choose to feel, feel it ALL every single ounce of pain, with eyes wide open....In the very less traveled road of truly getting healthy. Oddly enough it's also not the \"cool\" thing to do, and EVERYONE will tell you all the time what YOUR doing wrong. Meanwhile, as this chapter in my life comes to a close, the sadness is such a heavy feeling for me. I'm left feeling extremely misunderstood, unwilling to trust anyone, a whole lot of wasted investments, yet I have learned the biggest lessons of my life, I'm not bitter, I wouldn't change a thing, but WOW people have blown my mind like never before in the past. I was raised with pure evil, at least then I always knew where the people were I could see that they were to hurt me. In the past six months, this was totally way worst beast, you don't even see them coming, Bad Form! I have been told lies right to my face for no other reason, but they were looking out for themselves. The really crazy thing is, after spending 10 years with me first and foremost, if you know anything about me, you KNOW I would never do things any of the things said people were so concerned about. It disgust me truly to my core, how one month you can tell someone how in love with them you are, and the very next month your asking them if they are going to get you for abandonmeof the home. I would eat out of a garbage can before I let my X wife pay me monthly money.......Outrageous!!!!! That's what they say,and I say they because I couldn't just do this privately with my wife and I, in true form I had to do this with the parents too. Yet that is what they were focused on She gets the house, we paid 111,000 its worth 145,000 the work was (90% done by me) Parents buy for 125,000. They keep telling me it's a GREAT deal, I'm so sick, so beat down I can't even fight it anymore, . 1/4 of a brain knows who gets the shit end of the stix. The way I pockit games, I don't do. Shocked by it all.here is a time I relize actions all love or no love I deserve so much more from a partner in life! I deserve to be loved with the same deep forever love I once gave....next few the will be I hmuch more on the sunny side On to the next chapter!"
