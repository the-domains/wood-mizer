description: "So I went about 34 years without ever falling in love, never being broken up with, the falling in love part well that was because I made sure I was shut down to all of those feelings. Why....I never felt grounded to a place, time would always pass and something would beat in me and I just would have to find a new adventure. On top of that I truly did not think I was capable of giving myself in that way. Why did I never get dumped....everyone I dated I believe truly liked, and some loved me a great deal. I have broken more people then I would like to think about, not because I wanted to, I just couldn't give what they were asking for. Sometimes it was the unfortunate case of being just an unhealthy relationship, and I need to walk away. Then out of no where she walks through my door and as crazy as it sounds it was love at first site. I tried with everything that I'm made of to fight it, I even started a fight with her and told her not to talk to me any more. That did not work because we got married, never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be married, yet be married to my soul mate. She was my everything, I had so many first feelings with her, I truly believed together no matter what came our way, we would always come out on top. I will spare you all the details, I will say Nov. age 40 she asked me for a divorce, there is no malevolent in her I don't blame her for leaving, yet I don't agree with it, we took vows, and how she left was just wrong. Needless to say this on top of a life of non stop surviving trauma a need to pause for a moment, because I can no longer find my go shoes, and that's scary as a hole full of spiders!"
