description: "Oddly at the age six I was standing there outside in my front yard of a huge thug trailer park by the bonfire, watching the fire sparks float high in the air. I remember this like it was today, Zeppelin was playing very load I didn't know then, but now I know it was the Immigrant song. That day there was a big party, pretty much all of my DNA, everyone was as load as the radio, and walking very wobbly holding beer cans, or liquor bottles. For some reason I took a long look around, everything seemed to be in slow motion I thought to myself......I don't ever want to be like them, or live in a place like this when I grow up."

Oddly at the age six I was standing there outside in my front yard of a huge thug trailer park by the bonfire, watching the fire sparks float high in the air. I remember this like it was today, Zeppelin was playing very load I didn't know then, but now I know it was the Immigrant song. That day there was a big party, pretty much all of my DNA, everyone was as load as the radio, and walking very wobbly holding beer cans, or liquor bottles. For some reason I took a long look around, everything seemed to be in slow motion I thought to myself......I don't ever want to be like them, or live in a place like this when I grow up.Looking back on that now, I think WOW that's a pretty intense thought for a six year old! I truly believe that is when my life battle to get out, and be better then what I was born in to. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ef256db0-469f-44ba-bc1b-8e8382c3227d.jpg)
