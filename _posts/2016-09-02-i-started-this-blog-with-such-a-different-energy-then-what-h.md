  I started this blog with such a different energy then what has evolved. I
  never expected in a million years of all feeling to feel like this. Out of all
  my ups and downs in life the one thing I have never experienced before is
  depression. I feel so low and so beaten I can't find anything that gives me
  joy. I don't understand this feeling of total heart break,  and emptiness. I
  can't shake it, and it saddins me so much, to know how much of my gift of life
  I'm just throwing away.  Yet I have no control over this mind set. This
  constant state of no control is so incredibly frustrating for me! I feel
  powerless to help myself, and yet I'm doing everything possible to help
  myself. I need to be let up for just a breathe or two, and then maybe I can
  get back in the game. Without air I'm diying and I have not finished yet.
