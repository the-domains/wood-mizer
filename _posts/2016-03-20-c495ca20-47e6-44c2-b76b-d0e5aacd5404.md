That saying....The little things, for me my whole life, its always been the really big little things. I had just walk through this magical lavender farm, with a light fog and mist of rain dampening my face. There were little fairy houses every where you looked, in the bases of trees, under rocks made as caves, and everything just had the most relaxing aroma of lavender.

As the walk was coming to an end as all good things do, what do I catch out of the corner of my left eye......right there in the ground growing wild, my favorite flower!!!!!! It's an orchid, I couldn't believe it, all the care and time I have to give to these amazing plants, and these are WILD! Truly I was in a magical place that day, and very thankful my eyes were wide open to see all the gifts we are surrounded by, yet rarely see.

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
ttle things. I had just got finished walking through the most whimsical lavender farm, on a hot and just a slite dew rain, with a light fog in the air. It was magic, Truly I felt like a child wanting to play hide and seek.

Then as the walk was almost over, the magic just kept coming. Growing right on the side of the trail next to a pine tree Orqiods my all time favorit! Wild!

One of my favorit parts of experionce living is when my eyes are truly open!
