WOW.......the wiring of our brains,  \[Sparse Coding\], I used to go about my life NEVER giving this one moment of my neurons time! Now there's days I have to stop myself from becoming fixated on it. You see this is my goal, my journey, and my road to my recovery in being healthy. Here's my...how do I say, life's work as a person to over come: I got P.T.S.D. as a very young child. Also it was from multiple incidents, and if P.T.S.D. is not caught and treated early your pretty much stuck with it for life. I didn't start treating mine until 5 1/2 years ago, really I didn't even know what it was for years, I thought I was crazy. I used to refer to the problem as movies that played in my head, only to myself OF COURSE!  We can sustain our brain with 86 billion tightly  packed neurons. That's 40% more then the ape. I'm sure everyone knows the brain is the most complex organ we have, yet to really put that in perspective is mind blowing. Is what at times is overwhelming to me is in order to get healthy  my brain is wired for the past 37 years to survive, now I have to rewire it to live. Believe me I have yet to back down or quit any challenge in my life, nor do I intend to do so with this one. I also have made peace with the fact that it will be something I will do most likely for the rest of my life. I want to be very clear about what I'm going to say next......My psychiatrist said something to me not to long ago that at the time did not really hit me until a couple weeks later. She said,"Mindy the only way your childhood could have been worse is if you were in slaved." Now I say this for a few different reasons, what trauma is to me, from what I understand is not to other people. I have seen and been through so much of it I don't even understand how bad it was to the full extent. Now with that being said, I still completely understand, and know I went through things no child should ever go though or even be aware of in those years. At the same time I also would not change one thing, it made me who I am, the good, and the really really hard. Life is a gift no matter what or who you believe in, and our lessons are the BIGGEST part of it \[in my opinion\] not every lesson is a happy one, or a easy one, but almost always those are the most important, in my experience. I will admit I do feel like my life has been A LOT of hard lessons not by my hand, and sometimes it gets really hard on my soul. At the same time no matter how hard it ever gets I will NEVER cry why me, or wish for another life, because all those little BIG moments in my life were the most beautiful, unforgettable treasures that were worth it all! Maybe the journey of the lessons brings us to the little BIG moments. I will give this my best, because I owe it to the gift I was giving, life......Yet it does not change the fact that I'm truly more terrified about this self work then anything else in my life. WOW.....that was a very honest feeling.      ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8c115902-7d1f-4069-9219-70fff2abad50.png)
