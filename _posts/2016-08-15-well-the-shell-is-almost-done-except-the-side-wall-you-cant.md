  Well the shell is almost done except the side wall you can't see. I tell you
  what this shop build has truly taken a lot out of me. I have tried to keep my
  stress to a small amount, and considering everything I have done pretty good.
  Yet being out of work and having to be really crafty on how to come up with
  supplies has almost drained me. I made the decision to walk away from my life
  with basically my truck, and my business equipment, that being said, I have
  had some curve balls thrown my way. So my equipment is not really stored in a
  weather tight conditions as of now. So this build has been extremely important
  to a point. On the other hand I can only do, what I can do. Truly, and
  honestly my back feels like it's never going to be right again, I'm so
  exhausted, yet seem to only get three hours sleep a night. I'm supposed to be
  resting, and letting my mind take a break, yet I cannot seem to be able to do
  that. I will keep marching on, yet my feet feel heavier than I can ever
  remember, and I don't know why, but I really believe that this is the way it
  is for me. It always has been, and I cannot see it changing. So ironic though
  everyone sees all these great things in me, and believe me, I do too. Yet this
  forever struggle, with only moments of air…I will take my hand, and I will
  play it. Yet if someone is listening, I could use a little help, a brake,
  pause….maybe just send me one, just one friend, you know the kind that's there
  through thick and thin, like oldskool I could REALLY use one right now bad. In
  the mean time weather that's answered or not I will keep on, keeping on.
