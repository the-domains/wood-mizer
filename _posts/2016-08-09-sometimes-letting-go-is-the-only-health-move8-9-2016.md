  You know when one gets, sick, with a mental illness, in my case P.T.S.D. You
  come to realize that the people who you called your best friends and family
  can’t, or don't want to deal with it. Your made to feel like a deceased person
  who is no longer wanted around. Yet out of the 20 or so a couple manage to
  still come around once in awhile. This I guess hit me exceptionally hard
  because so many times in my life I have been abandoned. Now it happened all
  over again, and now again with the Divorce. My ex wife desided she was no
  longer in love with me in November 2015. It took me a bit longer to put that
  behind me. Yet in the pass of couple months I have came to a really ok place
  with it. I have had to come to some hard realizations, and things are for the
  best. So lets get back to basics I thought I could get my Best Friend back now
  (my x wife) We meet, have some pretty deep, pretty great conversation. She
  states how much of a great time she had, great! I had asked about a statement
  she made when she said I was the one pushing for the divorce thats why she
  rushed it through. I asked does that mean you wanted to give the seperation a
  while first. In true form, her answer is ding ding ding I can't answer that
  question. So what do I do try to support her feelings, and be that great
  friend we once were. What does she do….I'm not ready to be friends yet. Wow
  what a blow…one I just don't understand, she's not in love with me, states she
  wants our friendship back, I'm now in a great place to do that, and BAM! It's
  like the heart aches all over again, yet different, but holy cow I cannot take
  it anymore. I have done all I can, above and beyond, to mend whatever I could,
  and I playing the fool am the only one same as the marriage who is left giving
  a shit. So I have told her no more, don't contact me, phone, letter, or
  through someone else. Blocked numbers, and that's the way it has to be. I know
  that I'm a over sensitive person, and it sometimes controls my actions, but
  I'm working on that right now very hard. At the same time I have to protect
  myself from people who don't care to take a moment to release how there
  actions effect me. I need to stop giving all and getting nothing. Not to say
  that is a everything statement. Yet I have a couple of friends who have stuck
  around and I love them for that. Yet it's to hard, when the only time they
  want to hang is at there house, and talk about my life. I want to have fun,
  hang with my friends, go places, do things. I see them do it with everyone
  else, why not me? Plus it's all connected to my x wife, somehow I just feel
  like I'm always on display, like what is she going to do next, or something
  like that. Then is what truly and I mean truly kills me is I have bonded with
  a child like never before, and I have to lose that too. So much loss, so much
  hurt, I know it will ease up one day, and I'm waiting, in the meantime I will
  keep working on me, and not be better, or angry, because for some reason there
  is a lesson in all this, and a purpose, yet my heart is very heavy. I don't
  know if I'm doing the right thing, but I do know that I have to protect myself
  from continuing to get hurt by the people I care for most. It may not be the
  right way, but at this point in time it's the only way I know. So many shades
  of gray, and I just need to find peace in one of them.

You know when one gets, sick, with a mental illness, in my case P.T.S.D. You come to realize that the people who you called your best friends and family can't, or don't want to deal with it.
